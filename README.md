This repository contains experimental data from tensile tests conducted on white Ultimaker速 TPU 95A. Below are details about the equipment, type of test, and material properties:

## Equipment Used
The tensile tests were performed using a Shimadzu速 AG X-V2 universal testing machine, manufactured in Kioto, Japan. The tests were conducted at a loading rate of 0.1mm/s.

## Type of Test
The tensile tests were conducted according to the ASTM D638 standard for dogbone samples. This standard specifies the test method for tensile properties of plastics. Variation V was utilized.
The dogbone samples were oriented parallel to the tensile loading direction.

## Material Properties
Material: White Ultimaker速 TPU 95A
Printing Method: Additive manufacturing
Printer Used: Ultimaker速 3 printer
Additional Information
The mechanical properties data included in this repository were obtained from 7 tensile tests conducted on the described material.
